DAY1

initiated with a video over ways of communication , ways to easily communicate and develop a network
Application/Software -> Interpreter -> Kernel -> RAM,CPU,HardDisk (Kernel interacts with the hardware and checks for space availability. ##operating systems @Student's point of view~:
Windows(Closed Source)
Linux (Open Source)--> its a kernel and not an OS
Mac(Costly)

#To change backend code of Firefox~:
$ gedit /usr/bin/Firefox -> Change the Code

#Kernal(3 types)~:
NT(Windows) ~: .exe(extension) && Examples ~ (Windows 7,8,10)
LINUX -> RPM(.rpm) { used for bigdata in redhat } Debian(.deb) {used for ML in Ubuntu/mint}
DARWIN ~ :.dmg && Examples ~ (OSX , SNOWL)

#Few useful Linux Commands~:
$ mkdir folder-name{1..50} # {} encloses a range and creates 50 folder in linux
$ useradd user-name # Creates a new user
$ pinky # shows information of all available users
$ rm -f # Forcefully remove files
$ rm -fv # forcefully remove file with an action responding work done
press F2 # used to rename a file
$ cal September 1752 # shows september calendar with dates missing from 3 to 13
$ date +%Y # Current year
$ date +%A # Current Weekday
$ date +%T # Current Time
$ date --help # all options available with date command
$ cal -j # Shows Julean Calendar
$ bc # opens a calculator
$ ls -F # check which is folder and which is file in a directory
$ mkdir -p folder1/folder2 # both folders will be created together
$ rm -rf pi* # deletes all folders starting with 'pi' , use anything instead of 'pi'
$ su # switch users through command line

#Default Architecture of Windows~:
Main Account ~ : Admin
Text Editor ~ : Notepad
CMD
Internet Explorer
.exe based OS
OS Storage ~ : C Drive
C:\user\user-name # Stores info about environment of seperate users(Desktop,Downloads,Videos etc..)

#Default Architecture of Linux(Red Hat)~:
Main Account ~: root
Text editor ~: Gedit
Terminal
Firefox
.rpm based
OS Storage ~: /(backslash)
/home # Stores folders of different users each with seperate data
/root ~> Admin
Python Integration in Various Technologies~:
Pi (meu)python ~> Raspberyy pi
Web-App ~> Django,FLask

#All Databases
OS ~> Linux,Windows,Mac
Network --> Devices (Router,Switch,etc)
Bigdata
Cloud Computing
.NET ~> ironpython
JAVA ~> Jython

#To install Python 3.6 in rhel 7.5 server~ :
move to etc directory (using cd command)
move to yum.repos.d/ directory
create a new repo ~ > gedit adhoc.repo
write~ : [ad] # []these brackets can enclose anything, you can write Pykid instead as well. baseurl=http://13.234.66.67/summer19/python3 # online repository created by adhoc networks gpgcheck=0 # not to ask for certification
save it and run command yum install python3* -y
Python installed successully.

#Notes:
Calendar used by linux is called Georgian andd other available is Julean
CNCF ~ : A great open source Community
Python is an interpreted language.
Python provides reusability of memory ~ > (Stores the value and not the variable)
Each website we run on browser, temporarily stores all its information on local pc RAM
(75~80) % of the data in the world is stored in string format.
ML and AI both uses int/float values

#Data-Types~ :
Immutable
Python is strictly binded
examples ( int,float,str,byte,tuple)
Mutable *examples (list,set,dictionary)
